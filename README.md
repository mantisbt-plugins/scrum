## Description

to MantisBT.

## Requirements

The plugin requires [MantisBT](http://www.mantisbt.org/) version 1.2.6 or higher and PHP 5.6.

If the [Source Integration plugin](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/source-integration)
(version 0.16 or higher) is installed, the cards will display the number of
changesets attached to each issue.

The plugin is currently only tested with MantisBT 1.2*.


## Installation

1. Download or clone a copy of the [plugin's code](https://github.com/mantisbt-plugins/scrum).
2. Copy the plugin (the `Scrum/` directory) into your Mantis
   installation's `plugins/` directory.
3. While logged into your Mantis installation as an administrator, go to
   *Manage -> Manage Plugins*.
4. In the *Available Plugins* list, you'll find the *Scrum* plugin;
   click the **Install** link.
5. All settings are available after click on the plugin in the Plugin list.


## Usage

A new *Scrum Board* item is added to MantisBT's Main menu.

It will display issues for the currently selected Project as Scrum Cards,
which can be filtered by *Target Version* and *Category*, with the cards
distributed in columns based on their Status.

### Configuration

To change the Scrum Board's layout, go to the configuration page, where you
can define:

  - *Board Columns*: specifies which Status goes into which column;
    - *Name* is a language-independent code for the Board Column (refer to the
      language files for the actual display value)
    - *Status* is a comma-delimited list of Statuses from the Status Enumeration
      (*status_enum_string*) to include in the Column
  - *Board Severity Colors* and *Board Resolution Colors* respectively
    define which color to use for display of each severity and resolution code.
    It is a comma-delimited list of elements with the form *Code:Color*, the
    code being the key from the corresponding Enumeration (Severity and
    Resolution).
  - *Sprint Length* specifies the duration of a sprint (in days)
  - *Always show Status* when checked, the Status name will be displayed in
    the Scrum Board's columns even if there are no cards with this Status
    (unchecked by default).
  - *Token Expiry* determines how long the plugin will remember the filter
    criteria on the Scrum Board.
